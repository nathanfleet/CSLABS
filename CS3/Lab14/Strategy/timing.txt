==COMMENTS==
The measured run times for these different sorting algorithms
makes sense. The STL sort likely uses a combination of different
sorting algorithms which would explain its sort run time. Bubble
sort is a basic sorting algorithm with a O(n^2) complexity, which
would explain its long run time for the large dataset. The same
thing applies for insertion sort, its complexity is O(n^2).
