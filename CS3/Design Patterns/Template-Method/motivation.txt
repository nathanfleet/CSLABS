BEHAVIORAL PATTERN

The template method is a behavioral design pattern that
defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass
but lets subclasses override specific steps of the 
algorithm wihout changing its structure

Primitive Operations
- functions to be implemented in concrete class

Hook Operations
- may be overridden ; has a default implementation

Template method
- function in base class that uses primitive operations 
to accomplish a certain task
