prototype is a CREATIONAL design pattern that lets you copy existing
objects without making your code dependent on their classes

enum class Gender {Male, Female}; -- scoped and typed

Type Covariance -- overriding virtual function of derived class may 
accept or return types of derived class

Why create object prototype?
Because creating objects from scratch is too expensive

clone() --
returns the pointer to the copy of the prototype (virtual)
