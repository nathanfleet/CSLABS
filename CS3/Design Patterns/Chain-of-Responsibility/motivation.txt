BEHAVIORAL design pattern that lets you pass requests along a 
chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler 
decides either to process the request or to pass it to the 
next handler in the chain





handler --
declares the interface for all concrete handlers;

successor --
defines the next handler in the chain.
