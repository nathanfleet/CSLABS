Use the state pattern when you have an object that behaves differently
depending on its current state, and the state-specific code changes frequently

state is a BEHAVIORAL pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when
its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class

Context --
"concentrator" class whose objects actually have states,
passes operations to the state class

State --
Abstract class representing state with the set of abstract operation on 
the state
