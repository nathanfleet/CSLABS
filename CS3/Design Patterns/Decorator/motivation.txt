Decorator is a STRUCTURAL design pattern that lets you attach
new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

What does decorator design pattern do?
invokes the original component methods optionally decorating
it before or after invocation

-- used when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to
objects at runtime without breaking the code that uses these objects
