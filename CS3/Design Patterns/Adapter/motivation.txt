Adapter is a STRUCTURAL pattern that allows objects with incompatible
interfaces to collaborate

We use this pattern when we want to use some existing class, but its 
interface isn't compatible with the rest of your code.

Adapter (wrapper) --
concrete class that inherits from interface

Adaptee --
implementation class whose interface is modified (adapted)

Object Adapter?
uses delegation from adapter to Adaptee

Multiple Inheritance --
class C : public A, private B {...};
