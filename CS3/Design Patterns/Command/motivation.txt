BEHAVIORAL design pattern that turns a request into a 
stand-alone object that contains all information about the 
request.

Command --
declares an interface for executing the operation, declares
execute()

Concrete Command --
implements execute(), acts on receiver

Client -- creates the concrete command object and sets up its
receiver

Receiver --
object on which operations are performed

Invoker --
Asks to execute the command
