Composite is a STRUCTURAL design pattern that lets you 
compose objects into tree structures and then work with these
structures as if they were individual objects

composite ONLY makes sense wehn the core model of your app can
be represented as a tree **

component -- abstract uniform interface class for both 
collections and primitive items

leaf -- concrete primitive class

composite -- collection that possibly consists of leaves or 
other composites, implements interface and access to children
/parents
