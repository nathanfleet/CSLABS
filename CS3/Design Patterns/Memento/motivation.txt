BEHAVIORAL design pattern that lets you save and restore the
previous state of an object without revealing the details of 
its implementation

originator -- 
creates memento containing snapshot of current state, uses 
memento to restore state

memento --
stores internal state of originator, only originator may see
internals

caretaker -- 
keeps memento, does not access or examine memento's contents
