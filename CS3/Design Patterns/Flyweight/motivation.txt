STRUCTURAL design pattern that lets you fit more objects
into the avaliable amount of RAM by sharing common parts
of state between multiple objects instead of keeping
all of the data in each object

abstract flyweight --
defines interface for the intrinsic part

concrete flyweight--
implements the intrinsic part

client--
stores the extrinsic part of the object

factory--
maintains the collection of flyweight objects

intrinsic -- 
state independent part to be stores in the Flyweight object

extrinsic --
stateful part to be stored in the client
